# NBA Game Day Notifications / Sports Alerts System

## **Project Overview**
This project is an alert system that sends real-time NBA game day score notifications to subscribed users via SMS/Email. It leverages **Amazon SNS**, **AWS Lambda and Python**, **Amazon EvenBridge** and **NBA APIs** to provide sports fans with up-to-date game information. The project demonstrates cloud computing principles and efficient notification mechanisms.

## **Features**
- Fetches live NBA game scores using an external API.
- Sends formatted score updates to subscribers via SMS/Email using Amazon SNS.
- Scheduled automation for regular updates using Amazon EventBridge.
- Designed with security in mind, following the principle of least privilege for IAM roles.

## **Prerequisites**
- Free account with subscription and API Key at [sportsdata.io](https://sportsdata.io/)
- Personal AWS account with basic understanding of AWS and Python

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ifeanyiro9/game-day-notifications.git
cd game-day-notifications
```

### **Create an SNS Topic**
1. Open the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the SNS service.
3. Click Create Topic and select Standard as the topic type.
4. Name the topic (e.g., gd_topic) and note the ARN.
5. Click Create Topic.

### **Add Subscriptions to the SNS Topic**
1. After creating the topic, click on the topic name from the list.
2. Navigate to the Subscriptions tab and click Create subscription.
3. Select a Protocol:
- For Email:
  - Choose Email.
  - Enter a valid email address.
- For SMS (phone number):
  - Choose SMS.
  - Enter a valid phone number in international format (e.g., +1234567890).

4. Click Create Subscription.
5. If you added an Email subscription:
- Check the inbox of the provided email address.
- Confirm the subscription by clicking the confirmation link in the email.
6. For SMS, the subscription will be immediately active after creation.

### **Create the SNS Publish Policy**
1. Open the IAM service in the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to Policies → Create Policy.
3. Click JSON and paste the JSON policy from gd_sns_policy.json file
4. Replace REGION and ACCOUNT_ID with your AWS region and account ID.
5. Click Next: Tags (you can skip adding tags).
6. Click Next: Review.
7. Enter a name for the policy (e.g., gd_sns_policy).
8. Review and click Create Policy.

### **Create an IAM Role for Lambda**
1. Open the IAM service in the AWS Management Console.
2. Click Roles → Create Role.
3. Select AWS Service and choose Lambda.
4. Attach the following policies:
- SNS Publish Policy (gd_sns_policy) (created in the previous step).
- Lambda Basic Execution Role (AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole) (an AWS managed policy).
5. Click Next: Tags (you can skip adding tags).
6. Click Next: Review.
7. Enter a name for the role (e.g., gd_role).
8. Review and click Create Role.
9. Copy and save the ARN of the role for use in the Lambda function.

### **Deploy the Lambda Function**
1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Lambda service.
2. Click Create Function.
3. Select Author from Scratch.
4. Enter a function name (e.g., gd_notifications).
5. Choose Python 3.x as the runtime.
6. Assign the IAM role created earlier (gd_role) to the function.
7. Under the Function Code section:
- Copy the content of the src/gd_notifications.py file from the repository.
- Paste it into the inline code editor.
8. Under the Environment Variables section, add the following:
- NBA_API_KEY: your NBA API key.
- SNS_TOPIC_ARN: the ARN of the SNS topic created earlier.
9. Click Create Function.


### **Set Up Automation with Eventbridge**
1. Navigate to the Eventbridge service in the AWS Management Console.
2. Go to Rules → Create Rule.
3. Select Event Source: Schedule.
4. Set the cron schedule for when you want updates (e.g., hourly).
5. Under Targets, select the Lambda function (gd_notifications) and save the rule.


### **Test the System**
1. Open the Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.
2. Create a test event to simulate execution.
3. Run the function and check CloudWatch Logs for errors.
4. Verify that SMS notifications are sent to the subscribed users.


### **What We Learned**
1. Designing a notification system with AWS SNS and Lambda.
2. Securing AWS services with least privilege IAM policies.
3. Automating workflows using EventBridge.
4. Integrating external APIs into cloud-based workflows.


### **Future Enhancements**
1. Add NFL score alerts for extended functionality.
2. Store user preferences (teams, game types) in DynamoDB for personalized alerts.
3. Implement a web UI
